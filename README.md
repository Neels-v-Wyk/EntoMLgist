Insect detection/classification using YOLO, Visual Transformers, and NLP, using Airflow for continous data ingestion and training.

This repo is currently under construction. The work in progress:
- [ ] Set up Airflow
- [ ] Retrieve images from reddit's "what is this bug" subreddit
- [ ] Retrieve comments from the above as well
- [ ] Create a sample training data set which is manually labeled for insect identification
- [ ] Train YOLO to find insects
- [ ] Use NLP to extract insects from top comments on posts, for use in classification training
- [ ] Set up a ViT to classify insects
- [ ] Use Airflow for continious improvement
